When you have an account for production projects it becomes difficult to do more things and experimenting, because if most things are of quality and it is frowned upon to find repos in the account with unfinished or low quality projects, because this lowers the reputation, due to the existence of a feeling of doing something better and better. 

It becomes a job of reputation, rather than enjoyment.

**this repo is for all the beautiful shit**
