1 Write a program that loads the value 42 into the A register using the @ instruction.
2 Create a program that sets the D register to the value 10 using the D=A instruction.
3 Write a program that stores the value in the D register into the memory location pointed to by the A register using the M=D instruction.
4 Develop a program that increments the value in the D register by 1 and stores the result back into the A register using the A=D+1 instruction.
5 Create a simple program that jumps to the end of the program unconditionally using the 0;JMP instruction.
6 Write a program that compares two values and jumps to a specific location in the program based on the result. Use instructions like D;JGT, D;JEQ, D;JLT to implement conditional jumps.
7 Practice loading immediate values into registers. Write programs that load values like -1, 0, 1, etc., into the A and D registers using the @ instruction.
8 Explore different addressing modes such as direct addressing, indirect addressing, and indexed addressing. Write programs that utilize these addressing modes to access memory locations and perform operations.
9 Experiment with bitwise operations like AND, OR, and NOT. Write programs that perform bitwise operations on values stored in registers.
10 Implement stack operations using assembly instructions. Write programs that push and pop values onto/from the stack and perform arithmetic or logical operations.
